We show that unconstrained quadratic optimization over a Grassmannian is NP-hard. We then deduce the NP-hardness of unconstrained cubic optimization over the Stiefel manifold and the orthogonal group. As an addendum we demonstrate the NP-hardness of unconstrained quadratic optimization over the positive definite cone.
