Abstract:

With the fast development of big data, it has been easier than before to learn the optimal
decision rule by updating the decision rule recursively and making online decisions. We study
the online statistical inference of model parameters in a contextual bandit framework of sequential
decision-making. We propose a general framework for online and adaptive data collection
environment that can update decision rules via weighted stochastic gradient descent. We allow
dierent weighting schemes of the stochastic gradient and establish the asymptotic normality
of the parameter estimator. Our proposed estimator signicantly improves the asymptotic ef-
ciency over the previous averaged SGD approach via inverse probability weights. We also
conduct an optimality analysis on the weights in a linear regression setting. We provide a
Bahadur representation of the proposed estimator and show that the remainder term in the
Bahadur representation entails a slower convergence rate compared to traditional SGD due to
the adaptive data collection.
