title: "Recht-Ré noncommutative arithmetic-geometric mean conjecture is false"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/noncommutative-am-gm
excerpt: 'In this paper, we show that a conjecture of Recht and Ré is false. The conjecture is a noncommutative analogue of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality where n positive numbers are replaced by $n$ positive defnite matrices. Our approach relies on the noncommutative Positivstellensatz, which allows us to reduce the conjectured inequality to a semidefnite program and the validity of the conjecture to certain bounds for the optimum values, which we show are false for $n = 5$. The $n = 2, 3$ cases are shown to be true.

Our method is nonconstructive. A [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/42299f06ee419aa5d9d07798b56779e2-Paper.pdf) by Christopher De Sa gives counterexamples for all $n \geq 5$. The $n = 4$ case remains unsolved.

The ICML version unfortunately contains a printing error in conjecture 1. Check the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01510.pdf) for the correct statement.'

In this paper, we show that a conjecture of Recht and Ré is false. The conjecture is a noncommutative analogue of the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality where n positive numbers are replaced by $n$ positive defnite matrices. Our approach relies on the noncommutative Positivstellensatz, which allows us to reduce the conjectured inequality to a semidefnite program and the validity of the conjecture to certain bounds for the optimum values, which we show are false for $n = 5$. The $n = 2, 3$ cases are shown to be true.
